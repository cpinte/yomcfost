# yomcfost
yorick interface to the 3D radiative transfer code mcfost

This package has be replaced by [pymcfost](https://github.com/cpinte/pymcfost), but not all functions have been ported yet.
The code is not maintained anymore (I enjoyed Yorick, but the lack of global support led to the switch to python)

Some of the code is from the IPAG yorick package (on which the mcfost interface relied)
